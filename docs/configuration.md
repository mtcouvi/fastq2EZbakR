## Configuring fastq2EZbakR

In the `config/` directory you will find a file named `config.yaml`. If you open it in a text editor, you will see several parameters which you can alter to your heart's content. These parameters are split into two major sections, the first being those that are very important to check and alter as necessary, and the second being parameters whose default values are worth assessing but that are probably ok.

### Parameters you need to set

 The first parameter that you have to set is at the top of the file:

``` yaml
samples:
    WT_1: data/fastq/WT_1
    WT_2: data/fastq/WT_2
    WT_ctl: data/fastq/WT_ctl
    KO_1: data/fastq/KO_1
    KO_2: data/fastq/KO_2
    KO_ctl: data/fastq/KO_ctl
```
`samples` is the set of \[sample ID\]:\[path\] pairs, where the paths are to directories containing fastq files that you want to process. **NOTE: each directory must contain a single fastq file or pair of fastq files**. Delete the existing sample names and paths and add yours. The sample names in this example are `WT_1`, `WT_2`, `WT_ctl`, `KO_1`, `KO_2`, and `KO_ctl`. These are the sample names that will show up in the `sample` column of the output cB.csv file. The `:` is necessary to distinguish the sample name from what follows, the path to the relevant fastq-containing directory. The path can either be relative to the directory that you deployed to (i.e., `workdir` in this example), or an absolute path. In this example, the fastq files are located in a directory called `samples` that is inside of a directory called `data` located in `workdir`. 


The next parameter you have to set denotes the sample names of any -s4U control samples (i.e., samples that were not fed s4U or a similar metabolic label). This is only used to determine which samples should be analyzed for calling SNPs:

``` yaml
control_samples: ["WT_ctl", "KO_ctl"]
```

In this case, the samples named WT_ctl and KO_ctl are the -s4U control samples.

Next is a boolean indicating whether or not your data is paired-end:

```yaml
PE: True
```

(This will likely get removed in later versions and inferred automatically from the number of fastqs in one of your directories).

Below that is the path to the genome FASTA file that reads will be aligned to:

``` yaml
genome: data/genome/genome.fasta
```

This is followed by the path to the annotation GTF file:

``` yaml
annotation: data/annotation/genome.gtf
```

Make sure that the chromosome names denoted in the FASTA file are identical to what they are called in the GTF file. In addition, fastq2EZbakR assumes that your annotation has the following fields "gene_id" and "type", with "type" including entries "transcript" and "exon". This is pretty standard but is noted here for completeness.

You can then specify the aligner you would like to use:

```yaml
aligner: "star"
```
Currently, only STAR and HISAT2 are implemented, and I highly recommend using STAR. I used to advocate for HISAT-3N when aligning NR-seq data, but a [recent paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38381903/) showed that STAR is about as good (and in some cases even better) at aligning reads from an NR-seq experiment. In addition, HISAT-3N cannot be easily installed with conda, and is not as actively maintained as STAR. Finally, much of the cool functionality of fastq2EZbakR (e.g., assignment of reads to transcript equivalence classes and exon-exon splice junctions) are currenlty only possible with the output of STAR.


This is followed by the path to the alignment indices:

```yaml
indices: data/indices/star_index
```

You can either provide these yourself, or have fastq2EZbakR create them automatically. In the latter case, just be aware that index creation is a RAM and time intensive process. Indexing the human genome with STAR (and using the provided annotation to include splice junctions and exons in the indices) takes between 1 and 2 hours on a 12 core machine and requires around 100 GB of RAM.

Next you will specify the strandedness of your sequencing library:

```yaml
strandedness: "reverse"
```

The terminology used here is borrowed from HTSeq (though fastq2EZbakR uses featureCounts in place of HTSeq). "reverse" means that the first read in a pair (or the only read if your library is single-end) represents the reverse complement of the sequenced RNA. "yes" means that the first read represents the original sequence of the sequenced RNA. "no" means that your library is unstranded, though it is not recommended that you use an unstranded library for NR-seq data (if you have to though, make sure to count both T-to-C and A-to-G mutations).

Finally, what makes fastq2EZbakR special is all of the ways in which you can assign reads to features. In the `strategies` section, you can turn on one of these, denoted `Transcripts`:

```yaml
strategies:
    RSEMp: False
    Transcripts: False
```

Setting it to TRUE requires that you are using STAR as an aligner, and that you have provided fastq files as input (as opposed to bam files). This will parse the transcriptome aligned bam file produced as a part of STAR's output to assign reads to their "transcript equivalence class". This simply means assigning reads to the set of transcript isoforms with which they are compatible. This read assignment can be paired with EZbakR's isoform deconvolution function (`EstimateIsoformFractions()`) to infer isoform-specific kinetic parameters. 

`RSEMp` refers to RSEM+, which is an alternative isoform-specific kinetic parameter estimation strategy that fits a mixture model using bam files produced by RSEM (which requires as input bam files produced by STAR, so once again you need to be using STAR for this). This is a slightly more rigorous isoform deconvolution strategy, but comes with a major RAM and runtime disadvantage that usually makes it less preferable.

All other feature assignment strategies can be set in the `features` section:
```yaml
features:
    genes: True
    exons: True
    transcripts: False
    exonic_bins: True
    junctions: True
    eej: True
    eij: True
```

These are:

* `genes`: Assignment of reads to the gene(s) to which they align. A read will be assigned to a gene if it overlaps with any part of the gene.
* `exons`: Assignment of reads to gene(s) to which they align. A read will ony be assigned to a gene if it strictly overlaps annotated exonic regions of that gene. **NOTE**: featureCounts has a slight suboptimality that makes it impossible to perform this assignment with 100% accuracy. This is because soft-clipped bases are counted as not overlapping any feature, so an arbitrary non-zero cutoff for the number of non-overlapping bases has to be set to avoid failing to assign all soft-clipped reads. The `Transcripts` strategy described above is a more rigorous way of determining if a read only aligned to annotated exonic regions.
* `transcripts`: Like `Transcripts`, tries to assign reads to transcript equivalence classes. In practice though, featureCounts is unable to account for the set of splice junctions a read overlaps when performing assignment, so this is a suboptimal assignment strategy that may be removed in future releases. It is here in the hopes that featureCounts will eventually support transcript equivalence class assignment. It also is compatible with any aligner and with providing bam files as input.
* `exonic_bins`: Assignment of reads to exonic bins, as defined in the original [DEXSeq paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3460195/). Best to pair with `Transcripts` or `exons` to filter out reads overlapping intronic regions, as this assignment strategy works like `genes` an will assign reads regardless of whether they overlap any non-exonic regions.
* `junctions`: Only compatible with STAR alignment. Uses the custom jI and jM tags to identify the set of exon-exon junctions a read overlaps.
* `eej`: A hack that attempts to mimic `junctions` but in a way that does not require STAR alignment or custom tags. A custom annotation is created automatically that includes annotation of exon-exon junction reads, that if a read aligns to, and if the `sj` column always included in the output cB is TRUE, indicates that the read likely overlapped the respective exon-exon junction.
* `eei`: Similar to `eej`, hacky strategy to use featureCounts to assign reads to exon-intron junctions. Use this and `eej` with caution.
